## Metro 2100: The last line in Singapore
In a post-apocalyptic world where humanity teeters on the brink of extinction, you are the last surviving human in the underground city of Singapore. The once bustling Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system lies dormant, its trains motionless and its stations deserted.
As the sole hope for the city's revival, you embark on a perilous journey through the abandoned tunnels, dodging remnants of the past and facing unimaginable dangers. Your mission is clear: reach the control station and reboot the train system, restoring the heartbeat of the city and enabling its few remaining inhabitants to travel safely once more.
But you are not alone in the darkness. Mysterious forces seek to thwart your every move, their motives unknown and their power formidable. Can you outwit these enigmatic foes, unlock the secrets of the MRT's control station, and bring light back to the shadows? The fate of the city rests in your hands.
